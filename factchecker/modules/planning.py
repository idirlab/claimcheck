The available knowledge is insufficient to assess the Claim.
Therefore, propose a set of actions to retrieve new and helpful evidence. Adhere to the following rules:
The actions available are listed under Valid Actions, including a short description for each action. No other actions are possible at this moment.
For each action, use the formatting as specified in Valid Actions.
Include all actions in a single Markdown code block at the end of your answer.
Propose as few actions as possible but as much as needed. Do not propose similar or previously used actions.
Consider Both Modalities Equally: Avoid focusing too much on one modality at the expense of the other, but always check whether the text claim is true or false.
Compare Image and Caption: Verify the context of the image and caption.
